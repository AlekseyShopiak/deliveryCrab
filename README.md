This is simulation of mail delivery system.
 
In project we have class main which helps us to interact the delivery system. Also it makes our project protected 
 from outside intervention. 

Main element in our simulation is a parcel. Parcels spawn in the storages (smth like post offices). 
Then they are loaded on the trucks. When the truck is full it goes to next route storage. 
There are big storages and smaller ones. Small storage is connected to a big one. 
Trucks can go from the big storage to big storage or from big to connected small.
The parcel will not be delivered immediately because storages have coordinates and trucks have velocity.

If you get CORS error, try to open index.html with a live server.
You can do it, for example, by installing live server extension in VScode.
